# What is this?

As part of new drive to be better at CTFs, cybersecurity, pen-testing, and more, I'm trying to compile and build knowledge bases for myself and anyone who would seek to use them. In a field where everything is online, it's just not centralized enough for my liking.

This is more of an educational project for myself, and as a general resource. I find that putting every crypto challenge in one directory in one repo, is better than having them spread out across different repos.

A very tangental interest of machine is machine learning. I suppose having a nice database of CTF challenge writeups would make for an interesting experiment with machine learning, maybe teach an AI to CTF?
